# mignette

The goal of the R package `mignette` (**Mig**ratory **net**work **t**ools **e**nsemble) is to streamline the process for researchers to develop migratory network models. The core function of `mignette` is to model the connectivity of populations across different stages of the annual cycle. To model these migratory networks in `mignette`, users need to provide:

1. Migratory connectivity data
2. Abundance data

## Installation

You can install the development version of `mignette` from GitHub with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("mgdesaix/mignette")
```

## Instructions

See the [Creating Migratory Networks in R](https://mgdesaix.github.io/connectivity-book/) page for detailed instructions on using `mignette`.

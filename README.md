# Mignette

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of the R package `Mignette` (**Mig**ratory **net**work
**t**ools **e**nsemble) is to streamline the process for researchers to
develop migratory network models for migratory species. Right now the
focus is on implementation for the focal bird species of our group,
using population genetic assignment data. We will expand on this in the
future.

## Installation

You can install the development version of Mignette from GitHub with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("mgdesaix/Mignette", auth_token = "xxx")
```

## Instructions

See the [Creating Migratory Connectivity Networks in
R](https://mgdesaix.github.io/connectivity-book/) page for details.

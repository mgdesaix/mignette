The goal of the R package `mignette` (**Mig**ratory **net**work
**t**ools **e**nsemble) is to streamline the process for researchers to
develop migratory network models. The core function of `mignette` is to
model the connectivity of populations across different stages of the
annual cycle. To model migratory networks in `mignette`, users need to
provide:

1.  Migratory connectivity data
2.  Abundance data

## Installation

You can install `mignette` from GitHub with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("mgdesaix/mignette")
```

## Instructions

See the [Creating Migratory Networks in
R](https://mgdesaix.github.io/connectivity-book/) page for detailed
instructions on using `mignette`.

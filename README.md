# MuSpTest

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

**NOTE: This is a package in development that is currently for use
within the DOE project on migratory species connectivity and network
models**

The goal of MuSpTest is to streamline the process for researchers to
develop connectivity models for migratory species. Right now the focus
is on implementation for the focal bird species of our group, using
genetic population assignment data. We will expand on this in the
future.

## Installation

You can install the development version of MuSpTest from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:
